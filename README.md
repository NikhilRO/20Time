# 20 Time Project 
A log to record progress and learning. This readme will be updated as a log file for the project, and any data files (if necessary) will be found within the repo. 

##Topic
The idea is to make some headway into the fascinating world of electronics, and the concept of designing and building them; also, manipulating them through software. Some initial ideas are electronic skateboard, toy cars with some sensor capabilitity, fundamentals of drones etc. 


Increasing number of people are adopting system on a chip (SoC) approach for their DIY projects; this could be interesting to look at.
######[Edit from second half of the project]

####Week 1 (Sept 18 - 24)
* Researched on the process of making electronics including, but not limited to the development cycle, software to design them (AutoCAD seems prominent), prototyping (can be expensive; 3D printer helps) and places to buy components (ebay can help).

####Week 2 (Sept 25 - Oct 1)
* Started learning about circuits. Watching tutorials online and asked friends for recommendations for buying components to build first circuit.

###Week 3 (Oct 2 - 8)
* Continued to work on circuits; making circuits for different purposes such as light combinations and motors. Understanding the practical purposes of circuits and its limitations. 

####Week 4 (Oct 9 - 15)
* Learning how to design electronics using computers. Computer-aided design (CAD) basically involves designing physical objects on computer. In the electronics industry, CAD is called Electronic Design Automation (EDA).
* Understanding different programmming options and even, the need for such software.  

####Week 5 (Oct 16 - 22)
* Trying to understand where this project is going. In pursuit of that, exploring [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). Pros-Cheap, easily accessible. Understanding the uses of Raspberry Pi and its potential.

####Week 6 (Oct 23 - 29)
* Ordered a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.amazon.ca/CanaKit-Raspberry-Micro-Supply-Listed/dp/B01E4HDIO4/ref=sr_1_4?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1479316771&sr=1-4&keywords=raspberry+pi+3) along with microSD card and power adapter. I think I will use it as a remote server (for plex). Online community says you can even control the installed linux remotely. 

####Week 7 (Oct 30 - Nov 5)
* Revisiting some previous concepts in order to organize information; also, start preparing for the end.

####Week 8 (Nov 6 - Nov 12)
* Got the RPi. Installed OS(s) on the microSD Card. Had to get 2.5A power supply. 
* Using it as media server for now but looking at other options. 
* I used [Plex](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-plex-server/) because it looks slick. Another option is Kodi(XMBC). 

####Week 9 (Nov 13 - Nov 19)
* Set up RPi to [function remotely](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/) through Windows 10. 
* Installed [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/) to view graphical interface using VNC.
* Accessed SSH(Secure Shell) using [putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)
* For user-friendly file transfer set up SFTP(Secure FTP) using [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)

####Week 10 (Nov 20 - 26)
* To follow

####Week 11 (Nov 27 - Dec 2)
* To follow
